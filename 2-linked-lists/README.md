# Linked Lists

A Linked List represents a sequence of nodes

Singly Linked means that each node points to the next element

Doubly Linked means that each node points to the next node and previous node.

## Advantages

You can add and remove items from the beginning of the list in constant time

## Disadvantages
To access an element in the array you need to iterate through the elements in
the list. (so, not in contant time)
